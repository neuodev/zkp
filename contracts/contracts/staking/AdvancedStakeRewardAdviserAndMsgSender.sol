/***
 * @title AdvancedStakeRewardAdviserAndMsgSender
 * @notice The "zero reward adviser" for the `RewardMaster` that sends `STAKE` action messages over
 * the PoS bridge to the STAKE_MSG_RECEIVER.
 * @dev It is assumed to run on the mainnet/Goerli and be authorized with the `RewardMaster` on the
 * same network as the "Reward Adviser" for "advanced" stakes.
 * As the "Reward Adviser" it gets called `getRewardAdvice` by the `RewardMaster` every time a user
 * creates or withdraws an "advanced" stake. It returns the "zero" advices, i.e. the `Advice` data
 * structure with zero `sharesToCreate` and `sharesToRedeem`.
 * On "zero" advices, the RewardMaster skips creating/redeeming "treasure shares" for/to stakers.
 * If the `getRewardAdvice` is called w/ the action STAKE (i.e. a new stake is being created), this
 * contract sends the STAKE message over the "Fx-Portal" (the PoS bridge run by the Polygon team)
 * to the STAKE_MSG_RECEIVER on the Polygon/Mumbai. The STAKE_MSG_RECEIVER is supposed to be the
 * `AdvancedStakeActionMsgRelayer` contract that processes the bridged messages, rewarding stakers
 * on the Polygon/Mumbai.
