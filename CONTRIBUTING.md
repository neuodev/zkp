# Contributing to `panther-core`

## Issue tracking

Feedback on the code is very welcome; please first check that your bug
/ issue / enhancement request is not already listed here:

*   https://github.com/pantherprotocol/panther-core/issues

and if not then [file a new issue](https://github.com/pantherprotocol/panther-core/issues/new).

## Helping with development

Any [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
is extremely welcome!

However, given the complexity of the codebase, it is strongly
recommended to communicate with members of Panther's development
community via the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c)
or in the [web forums (Discourse)](https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/)
in advance of working on any changes.

Thanks in advance!
